# Food yield

Part of the [Campaign Map](README.md) design.

## Regeneration and farming bonuses

Regeneration speed depends on climate: the biome's Regeneration Percent, the same for all renewable food sources on the tile. Only a claimant's Settlement-scoped modifiers raise it (see [Replenishment](replenishment.md)). Terrain improvements and equipment add yield:

- Terrain improvement **Irrigation**: +50% yield.
- Terrain improvement **Farm (with crop)**: +300% yield.

Equipment bonuses chain by category, choosing the best available option in each category (e.g.
machinery is picked over a plough animal). One illustrative chain:

```
Machinery (100%)        / plough animal (50%)
  + hoe (20%)           / adze (10%)
  + chemical fertilizer (30%) / animal fertilizer (15%)
  + pesticides (20%)
```

So a farm with machinery, plough animal, hoe, animal fertilizer, and pesticides yields
`100% + 20% + 15% + 20% = 155%` (the plough animal is excluded because machinery wins its category).

**Productivity rate** is how much food one individual can collect:

| Action | Productivity Rate | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| FORAGE | 1.05 | One person collects enough food for 1.05 people. |

## Tile bonuses

Naturally occurring tile bonuses can also boost food:

| Bonus | Occurs on | Imparts |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Oasis | Desert | +100% food |
| Reef | Coastal | +100% food |

## Formula for units which consume (and expand population)

```
Food Harvested = ROUNDUP( IF( People × Productivity Rate < Starting Food,
                              People × Productivity Rate,
                              Starting Food ), 0 )

Food Remaining on Tile (end of turn) = ROUNDUP( IF( People − Food Harvested > 0,
                                                    People − Food Harvested,
                                                    People × 0.25 ), 0 )

Remaining Energy (of population after collecting food) = People after growth × (1 − Energy to extract food)
```
